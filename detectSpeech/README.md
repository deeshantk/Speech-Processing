### VAD_Energy


Voice Activity edges can be taken using VAD_Energy to collect proper portions from data.

It will return the indices of speech.


**NOTE =>** Data used here for collecting data is taken from [Here](https://ssd.mathworks.com/supportfiles/audio/google_speech.zip) where directory train only contains 1 second speech. So using VAD_Energy is okay here to detect only speech portion.
