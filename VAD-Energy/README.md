Voice Activity edges can be taken using VAD_Energy to collect proper portions from data.

Here sheechIndices will return the edges of speech.


**NOTE =>** Data used here for collecting data is taken from "https://ssd.mathworks.com/supportfiles/audio/google_speech.zip" where directory train only contains 1 secounds speech. So using VAD_Energy is okay here to detect only speech portion.
